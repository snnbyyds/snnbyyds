# Hi there

I'm currently studying at **Nanjing University** and have a passion for coding and open-source projects. Here‚Äôs a little about me:

- **Programming Languages:** Proficient in **C/C++**, **Java**, and **Python**.
- **LineageOS Enthusiast:** I love working with LineageOS and have successfully ported it for the **qti Lahaina on arm64** platform.
- **PixelExperience Contributor:** I was once a maintainer for **PixelExperience on fajita**.
- **Project Highlights:** In my first semester, I completed the [ICS PA project](https://nju-projectn.github.io/ics-pa-gitbook/ics2024/), a significant milestone in my academic journey. Then I made a RV32IMAFD emulator [SEMU](https://github.com/snnbyyds/semu) myself.
- **Learning New Skills:** This semester, I'm diving into the world of **algorithms** to sharpen my problem-solving skills.

Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate!
